00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,166
- THIS SEGMENT OF
THE VIDEO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION

2
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,333
IS "BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS:
INTRODUCTION."

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,833
AS A PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR,

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,333
YOU MAY COME ACROSS
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,266
IN YOUR DAY-TO-DAY INTERACTIONS
WITH STUDENTS.

6
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,800
THE INFORMATION
IN THIS PROGRAM

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,133
IS DESIGNED TO INFORM
AND EDUCATE YOU

8
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,966
SHOULD YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN SUCH A SITUATION.

9
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,633
IN THIS PROGRAM,
WE WILL BE COVERING

10
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:39,033
BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS,
WHAT THEY ARE,

11
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:40,600
AND WHERE THEY ARE FOUND.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,000
IN SEGMENT TWO,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,333
WE WILL REVIEW OSHA'S
BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN STANDARD.

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:49,000
SEGMENT THREE WILL OUTLINE
HOW TO AVOID EXPOSURE.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,166
AND IN THE FINAL SEGMENT
OF THIS PROGRAM,

16
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,066
WE WILL DISCUSS WHAT TO EXPECT
IF YOU ARE EXPOSED

17
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,733
AND ARRANGING FOLLOW-UP.

18
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,900
LET'S BEGIN
WITH A DEFINITION OF TERMS.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,133
ACCORDING TO

20
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,533
THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION,

21
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:02,700
OR OSHA,

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,533
BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS
CAN BE DEFINED AS...

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,500
HIV IS A VIRUS
THAT LEADS TO AIDS,

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,400
OR ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
SYNDROME.

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,900
HIV-INFECTED PERSONS
MAY HAVE NO SYMPTOMS

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,733
OR MAY HAVE SYMPTOMS
SUCH AS SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES,

27
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,233
FATIGUE, WEIGHT LOSS,

28
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,066
DIARRHEA, PERSISTENT DRY COUGH,
AND FEVER.

29
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,066
MANY HIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS

30
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,733
DO NOT SHOW THESE SYMPTOMS
FOR MANY YEARS.

31
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,233
HBV AND HCV
ARE LIVER DISEASES,

32
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,400
AND SYMPTOMS RANGE
FROM MILD ILLNESS

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
TO SERIOUS,
LONG-TERM ILLNESS,

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,066
WHICH COULD LEAD TO
LIVER DISEASE OR LIVER CANCER.

35
00:01:56,066 --> 00:02:00,800
MORE ABOUT THESE DISEASES
CAN BE FOUND AT CDC.GOV.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,200
THOUGH BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS
ARE RARE,

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,033
PEOPLE EXPOSED
TO THESE PATHOGENS

38
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,533
RISK SERIOUS ILLNESS
OR DEATH.

39
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,033
TRANSMISSION OF
BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS CAN OCCUR

40
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,700
WHEN DEALING WITH HUMAN BLOOD

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,533
AND OTHER POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS
MATERIALS, OR OPIMs.

42
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,700
THESE OPIMs INCLUDE:

43
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,366
BLOOD PRODUCTS,
SUCH AS PLASMA OR SERUM;

44
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,866
SEMEN;
VAGINAL SECRETIONS;

45
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,700
CEREBROSPINAL FLUID;

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,866
PLEURAL FLUID,
OR LUNG FLUID;

47
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:30,700
SYNOVIAL FLUID,
OR FLUID FROM YOUR JOINTS;

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,366
AMNIOTIC FLUID,
OR UTERINE FLUID;

49
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,866
PERITONEAL FLUID,

50
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,033
OR THE FLUID THAT FILLS
YOUR BODY CAVITY;

51
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,700
ANY BODY FLUID THAT IS VISIBLY
CONTAMINATED WITH BLOOD;

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,866
ANY BODY FLUID THAT
IS NOT EASILY DISTINGUISHED.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,233
ANY MATERIALS
FROM THE HUMAN BODY,

54
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,233
SUCH AS ORGANS AND FLUIDS,

55
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,566
CAN ALL BE
POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS,

56
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:08,233
AND PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN
IN CIRCUMSTANCES

57
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:11,233
WHERE YOU MAY ENCOUNTER
SUCH MATERIAL.

58
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,233
PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN
WHEN WORKING WITH

59
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:16,233
ALL ANIMAL BODY MATERIALS
AS WELL.

60
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,233
UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS
ARE RECOMMENDED

61
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:21,066
WHEN DEALING WITH ANY OPIMs.

62
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,400
ACCORDING TO OSHA,

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,400
THE CONCEPT OF
UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS IS THAT...

64
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,700
IN OTHER WORDS, TREATING
ANY POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FLUID

65
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,033
AS IF IT WAS INFECTED.

66
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,700
UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS
ARE ACHIEVED

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,533
BY USING GLOVES,
PARTICULARLY WHEN DEALING

68
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,033
WITH THESE TYPES OF POTENTIALLY
INFECTIOUS MATERIALS.

69
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:50,700
GOWNS AND PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,333
SHOULD ALSO BE USED
WHEN POSSIBLE.

71
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,266
THIS WILL BE COVERED
IN GREATER DEPTH

72
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:58,433
IN SEGMENT THREE,
"AVOIDING EXPOSURE."

73
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:02,166
TRANSMISSION OCCURS
IF INFECTIOUS BLOOD OR OPIM

74
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,833
IS INTRODUCED
INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.

75
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,500
THIS COULD HAPPEN
THROUGH PARENTERAL EXPOSURE,

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,833
WHICH IS A BREAK IN THE SKIN,

77
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,833
SUCH AS THROUGH A CUT
OR INJURY,

78
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,333
OR A CUT OR STICK
BY CONTAMINATED MATERIAL,

79
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,666
SUCH AS A NEEDLE
OR GLASS.

80
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,166
TRANSMISSION MAY ALSO OCCUR

81
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,166
THROUGH MUCOUS MEMBRANE
EXPOSURE,

82
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,500
SUCH AS THROUGH
THE EYE, NOSE, OR MOUTH,

83
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,166
OR THROUGH SEXUAL CONTACT

84
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,333
AND FROM AN INFECTED WOMAN
TO HER NEWBORN CHILD.

85
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,900
BODY FLUIDS NOT ANTICIPATED
TO BE INFECTED

86
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,066
WITH BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS
INCLUDE:

87
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:39,966
IF BLOOD IS VISIBLE,

88
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:42,800
THESE FLUIDS SHOULD BE TREATED
AS INFECTIOUS.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,966
HOWEVER, ALL THESE SECRETIONS
MAY BE POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS

90
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:49,133
FOR OTHER VIRAL OR BACTERIAL
INFECTIOUS MATERIALS,

91
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,633
AND GENERAL HYGIENE PRACTICES
ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

92
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,800
IF CONTACT WITH THESE MATERIALS
IS LIKELY.

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,300
AS A PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR,

94
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,466
YOU MAY RARELY IF EVER
COME IN CONTACT

95
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,200
WITH SOME OF THESE MATERIALS.

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,366
IT IS, HOWEVER,
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST

97
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:06,200
TO ACT RESPONSIBLY
AND BE INFORMED.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,866
THIS HAS BEEN A BRIEF REVIEW

99
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:10,200
OF WHAT
BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS ARE

100
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
AND WHERE THEY CAN BE FOUND.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,066
MORE INFORMATION
ON THESE SUBJECTS CAN BE FOUND

102
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:17,566
ON THE OSHA WEBSITE,
OSHA.GOV,

103
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,233
AND IN THE NEXT SEGMENTS
OF THIS PROGRAM.

104
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,066
THE INFORMATION
IN THE NEXT SEGMENTS

105
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,066
WILL EXPLAIN THE OSHA STANDARDS,

106
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,900
HOW TO AVOID EXPOSURE,

107
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,066
AND WHAT TO DO
IN THE EVENT OF EXPOSURE.

108
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:32,733
THIS CONCLUDES SEGMENT ONE,
"BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS."
